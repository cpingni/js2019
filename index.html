	<h3>
		<i>Specimen: Food</i> speculates in a near future where all food production
				becomes artificial. We no longer have the knowledge of what the original food used to look like.
				Agriculture and food production are disrupted due to climate change.
				Resulting in researchers looking for alternatives to traditional meat.
				<i>Specimen: Food</i> projects our lives into the future,
				we realized that we have to do everything we can to preserve endangered food.
				Food is cast into resin cubes in remembrance of its original shape and appearance.
